 CRE workflow as the orchestration layer that connects your smart contract events (onchain) with external systems (offchain).

Your contract: CoreMicroBank emits events like UserLiquidated.

CRE workflow: Listens for those events, then triggers an action (like calling Africa’s Talking SMS API).

Result: Blockchain → CRE → External API → User notification.

“pipeline” that proves your project isn’t just a contract or a UI — it’s a connected system that bridges onchain and offchain worlds.

 CRE — it removes the dependency on your UI/server to “glue” things together.
 CRE workflow: Provides the pipeline proof — showing that the blockchain event alone can trigger the SMS, even if the UI isn’t involved.


HOW IT WORKS
 Show UI: Trigger liquidation from React front end.

Explain: “Normally, my UI would call the SMS server. But now, CRE is listening directly to the contract.”

Show CRE logs/dashboard: Prove that the workflow detected the event and sent the SMS API call.

Wrap up: “This demonstrates the orchestration layer — blockchain events automatically trigger external actions via CRE.”
