3. Simulate Locally
Run the workflow locally to see logs:

bash
cre workflow simulate ./cre-workflows/workflow.yaml
This will print logs in your terminal:

Event detected (UserLiquidated)

HTTP request sent to Africa’s Talking

Screenshot these logs for your hackathon video.

4. Deploy to CRE Network
Push your workflow live:

bash
cre workflow deploy ./cre-workflows/workflow.yaml
You’ll get back a deployment ID or link.

That’s what you share in your submission.

Once deployed, you can view logs in the CRE dashboard (web UI tied to your Chainlink account).
